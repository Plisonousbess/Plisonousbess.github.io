		Dear Sir or Madam:<br><br>

		I am writing to apply for the lecturer pool position in the Celtic studies department.  I have enclosed my CV for your consideration, and I believe you will see that my experience qualifies me to teach Modern Irish, Reading &amp; Composition, Celtic history, Celtic literature, and most particularly Celtic linguistics. <br><br>

		I have specialized in the Irish language my entire academic career.  I studied linguistics at Rutgers University as an undergraduate, then attended graduate school at UC Santa Cruz, where I studied in a program notable for Irish linguistics.  I speak Irish fairly fluently, and I am deeply involved in the Irish language community in the Bay Area, as well as in Ireland.  I have long experience reading Irish literature in the Irish language as well as in English.  I have also studied the Breton, Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx languages, both as a theoretical linguist and as a student of language. I have worked with native speakers of Scottish Gaelic and Breton, at the University of Arizona and at UC Santa Cruz, respectively.  I am well acquainted with many of the world's leading experts in Celtic linguistics.<br><br>

		I am familiar with teaching, preparing course materials, holding office hours, advising students, and the other general duties required of teachers, through my six years of experience as a TA at UC Santa Cruz.<br><br>

		I believe my devotion to the study of the Celtic languages and my experience with the daily duties of teaching makes me an ideal fit for the position you have offered.  I look forward to speaking with you in person.<br><br>

		Thank you,<br><br>
