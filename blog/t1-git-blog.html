      Welcome to my technical blog.  Today I learned a lot about positioning in CSS, which is still one of the hard things for me here at DBC.  The gist is that the HTML by default puts elements in static position.  If you want to move them around relative to that ordinary position, you use relative positioning.  Fixed position fixes an element in the browser window, so it doesn't move even when you scroll.  Helpful for a navbar or something.  And absolute positioning positions the element relative to the HTML file, or whatever other element it's inside.  I also learned a neat trick for centering absolutely positioned elements, because you can't do it the normal way, with align.  Well, that's all for today.  Happy blogging!

    Version control seems to be pretty awesome, sonce you can keep track of changes across multiple users, and updates don't get crossed in the post.

Well, I've learned a lot this week, but it is for serious time for me to go to bed.  I'll update this later.  Goodnight!

  <p>One of my favorite websites is Google maps.  Partly because the content is so valuable that I can't recall how I lived without it.  But it is also impressive UI design.  Particularly in the new version, the entire screen is taken up by the map, with the controls relegated to the corners.  This allows you to concentrate on the map, which is after all the whole point of the site.  It is visually open, uncluttered, bright, sleek, and minimalist.  and it captures the inherent beauty of maps.  The content is entirely practical, and while it is overwhelming in scope, the browsing is intuitive and simple.  If you know what you're looking for, you find it, almost passively.  The only time I've been on the site for a long time is if I wanted to browse maps or aerial photographs randomly with no practical purpose, and even that experience is typically rewarding.</p>
  <p>I also like last.fm, the site that tracks your music listening habits.  This site has to show an enormous amount of very detailed information, but it manages to package it compactly and intuitively, and has versatile options for managing the UI interface.  It manages to look fairly simple, even though it's often just a number of lists and graphs in boxes.  Compared to other sites built on that design, it looks sleek and professional, and the long strings of thumbnail images somehow look decorative rather than cluttered.  Navigation can be counterintuitive at first, but the content is so well-tailored to the individual user that you always find something interesting. </p>
  <p>I also really used to like The Dish, with Andrew Sullivan, which unfortunately no longer exists.  I liked it largely because of its commitment to being ad-free and its criticism of journalists for sponsored content.  But it also had a simple and elegant design.  Many blogs offer distracting sidebars, but this one was a single column with whitespace on either side, and it had a relaxing effect.  Also, the inline photos were well-chosen and well-arranged.</p>
