To whom it may concern:

I am writing to apply for the lecturer pool position in the Celtic studies department.  I believe you will see that my experience qualifies me to teach Modern Irish, Reading &amp; Composition, Celtic history, Celtic literature, and most particularly Celtic linguistics.<br><br>

I studied linguistics at Rutgers as an undergraduate, then attended graduate school at UC Santa Cruz under Jim McCloskey.  I have specialized in the Irish language my entire academic career.  I speak Irish fairly fluently, and I am deeply involved in the Irish language community in the Bay Area, as well as in Ireland.  I have long experience reading Irish literature in the Irish language as well as in English.  I have also studied the Breton, Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx languages, both as a theoretical linguist and as a student of language.
