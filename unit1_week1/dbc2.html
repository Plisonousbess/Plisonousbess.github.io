<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._E._Housman">A.E. Housman</a> was born in 1859 and died in 1936.  <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7848/7848-h/7848-h.htm"><i>Last Poems</i></a> was published in 1922.  Many of the poems were written earlier but unpublished.  Housman wanted them to be published so that Moses Jackson, his great unrequited love, could read them before he died.

     West and away the wheels of darkness roll,<br>
         Day's beamy banner up the east is borne,<br>
     Spectres and fears, the nightmare and her foal,<br>
         Drown in the golden deluge of the morn.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
     But over sea and continent from sight<br>
         Safe to the Indies has the earth conveyed<br>
     The vast and moon-eclipsing cone of night,<br>
         Her towering foolscap of eternal shade.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
     See, in mid heaven the sun is mounted; hark,<br>
         The belfries tingle to the noonday chime.<br>
     'Tis silent, and the subterranean dark<br>
         Has crossed the nadir, and begins to climb.<br>
